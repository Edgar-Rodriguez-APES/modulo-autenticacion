# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The frontend application needs to integrate with the Auth Service microservice to provide complete authentication functionality. The Auth Service is deployed at `https://sus2ukuiqk.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/auth` and provides comprehensive authentication features including registration, login, token management, email verification, and password reset flows. The integration must handle all authentication scenarios, provide secure token management, and deliver a seamless user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to register for an account with email verification, so that I can access the platform securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits registration form with valid data THEN the system SHALL call POST /register endpoint with tenant_id, email, password, name, and role
2. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect user to email verification page with verification_token
3. WHEN user submits verification token THEN the system SHALL call POST /verify-email endpoint and activate the account
4. WHEN verification is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect user to login page with success message
5. WHEN registration fails due to validation errors THEN the system SHALL display specific field errors from the API response

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to login with my credentials and stay authenticated across sessions, so that I can access protected features without repeatedly logging in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL call POST /login endpoint and receive access_token and refresh_token
2. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL store tokens securely and redirect to dashboard
3. WHEN access token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh using POST /refresh endpoint
4. WHEN refresh token is invalid THEN the system SHALL redirect user to login page and clear stored tokens
5. WHEN login fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages based on error codes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to reset my password when I forget it, so that I can regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL call POST /forgot-password endpoint with email
2. WHEN reset email is sent THEN the system SHALL display confirmation message regardless of email existence
3. WHEN user clicks reset link with valid token THEN the system SHALL display password reset form
4. WHEN user submits new password with valid token THEN the system SHALL call POST /reset-password endpoint
5. WHEN password reset is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect to login with success message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure logout functionality that clears all session data, so that my account remains protected on shared devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks logout THEN the system SHALL call POST /logout endpoint with current refresh_token
2. WHEN logout request completes THEN the system SHALL clear all stored tokens from local storage
3. WHEN logout is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect user to login page
4. WHEN logout fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL still clear local tokens and redirect to login
5. WHEN user closes browser or tab THEN tokens SHALL remain stored for automatic login on return

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for all authentication scenarios, so that users receive clear guidance and the system remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API returns validation errors THEN the system SHALL display field-specific error messages
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display connectivity error messages with retry options
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL display appropriate wait time messages
4. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL display generic error messages without exposing technical details
5. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log events for monitoring while protecting user privacy

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automatic token management and security features, so that the application maintains security best practices without user intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN access token expires within 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the token
2. WHEN making authenticated requests THEN the system SHALL include valid Bearer token in Authorization header
3. WHEN tokens are stored THEN the system SHALL use secure storage mechanisms appropriate for the platform
4. WHEN password is entered THEN the system SHALL validate against security requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
5. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update UI components and route access accordingly
