# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating the Feedo and Forecaster AI agents with n8n workflows and the existing frontend platform. The integration will enable users to interact with specialized AI agents through a unified chat interface, supporting both text-based conversations and file processing capabilities. The system must maintain conversation context, handle authentication securely, and provide real-time feedback on agent processing status.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: N8N Webhook Integration

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to communicate with AI agents through n8n webhooks, so that I can leverage the existing n8n infrastructure for agent orchestration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message to an agent THEN the system SHALL send the request to the appropriate n8n webhook endpoint
2. WHEN the n8n webhook receives a request THEN it SHALL authenticate using the Feedo-Webhook-Secret header
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return a 401 error with appropriate error messaging
4. WHEN the webhook processes successfully THEN it SHALL return a structured response with chatId, response, type, and agentType fields
5. IF the request timeout exceeds 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL handle the timeout gracefully with user feedback

### Requirement 2: Conversation Context Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my conversations with agents to maintain context across multiple interactions, so that agents can provide coherent and contextually relevant responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a conversation with an agent THEN the system SHALL generate a unique persistent chatId
2. WHEN subsequent messages are sent THEN the system SHALL include the same chatId to maintain conversation continuity
3. WHEN a user switches between agents THEN each agent SHALL maintain its own separate conversation context
4. WHEN a user clears a conversation THEN the system SHALL generate a new chatId for future interactions
5. WHEN the application restarts THEN conversation history SHALL be preserved in localStorage

### Requirement 3: File Upload and Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload data files to the Feedo agent for analysis, so that I can get insights from my business data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a file THEN the system SHALL validate file type against supported formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, TXT)
2. WHEN file size exceeds 10MB THEN the system SHALL reject the upload with appropriate error messaging
3. WHEN a valid file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL send it to the n8n file processing endpoint
4. WHEN file processing begins THEN the system SHALL show upload progress and processing status
5. WHEN file processing completes THEN the agent SHALL provide analysis results and insights

### Requirement 4: Agent-Specific Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with specialized agents (Feedo and Forecaster) that have distinct capabilities, so that I can get targeted assistance for different business needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interacting with Feedo THEN the system SHALL provide file upload capabilities and data analysis features
2. WHEN interacting with Forecaster THEN the system SHALL provide forecasting and trend analysis capabilities
3. WHEN an agent is processing THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators and status messages
4. WHEN switching between agents THEN the system SHALL maintain separate conversation histories
5. WHEN quick commands are available THEN the system SHALL display agent-specific command shortcuts

### Requirement 5: Real-time Communication and Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive real-time feedback on agent processing status, so that I understand when agents are working on my requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is sent to an agent THEN the system SHALL immediately show a processing indicator
2. WHEN an agent is processing a request THEN the input field SHALL be disabled to prevent duplicate submissions
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL remove loading indicators and display the response
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with suggested actions
5. WHEN multiple files are being processed THEN the system SHALL show individual progress for each file

### Requirement 6: Authentication and Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all agent communications to be properly authenticated, so that unauthorized access to AI agents is prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making requests to n8n webhooks THEN the system SHALL include the Feedo-Webhook-Secret header
2. WHEN the webhook secret is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL handle authentication errors gracefully
3. WHEN user authentication expires THEN the system SHALL prevent agent interactions until re-authentication
4. WHEN sensitive data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use secure HTTPS connections
5. WHEN storing conversation data THEN the system SHALL associate it with authenticated user IDs

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback, so that I can understand and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN agent processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error details and suggested actions
3. WHEN file upload fails THEN the system SHALL indicate which files failed and why
4. WHEN timeout errors occur THEN the system SHALL allow users to retry their requests
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 8: User Interface Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want a seamless chat interface that integrates with the existing platform design, so that agent interactions feel natural and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the chat interface THEN it SHALL display available agents with their capabilities
2. WHEN selecting an agent THEN the interface SHALL show conversation history and input options
3. WHEN messages are exchanged THEN they SHALL be displayed in a clear, chronological format
4. WHEN file uploads are supported THEN the interface SHALL provide drag-and-drop functionality
5. WHEN quick commands are available THEN they SHALL be easily accessible through the interface

### Requirement 9: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want agent interactions to be responsive and reliable, so that I can work efficiently without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending messages THEN the system SHALL respond within 2 seconds for acknowledgment
2. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates every 5 seconds
3. WHEN multiple users interact simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain performance standards
4. WHEN conversation history grows large THEN the system SHALL implement efficient storage and retrieval
5. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle capacity limitations

### Requirement 10: Monitoring and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring of agent interactions, so that I can troubleshoot issues and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests are made to n8n THEN the system SHALL log request/response details
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error context and stack traces
3. WHEN file processing occurs THEN the system SHALL track processing times and success rates
4. WHEN users report issues THEN developers SHALL have access to relevant conversation logs
5. WHEN system performance degrades THEN monitoring SHALL alert administrators proactively
